             [TWEAKER]
             TWEAKER = 1
           or to add the word tweaker in the name of the program (for exemple : tweaker_081.exe)
           or add the word -tweak in the command line

	Property editor : 
           an edit has been added. It contains the values of the property (each of them is separate by comma)

           Copy/paste functions have been added for files (in the main list) and for properties (in the exemplar/cohort preview screen)
           These functions use the clipboard , so you copy/paste files/properties in the current Reader but also in another Reader.

        Main List :
           'Insert file from a template' : your templates or your favorites files can be inserted in the current opened DAT through this option.
            You need to copy these files in the 'template' folder and to edit the template.xml file.
            You have to add a new line in this xml file :
               <file name = "a_descriptive_name_for_your_file"   filename = "the_location_and_the_name_of_your_file"/>

            for exemple :
               <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
                 <template>	
     		    <file name = "exemplar" filename = "template\exemplar.eqz"/>            	
 		    <file name = "cohort"   filename = "template\cohort.cqz"/>
